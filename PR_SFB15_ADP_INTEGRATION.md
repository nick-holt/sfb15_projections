# PR: SFB15-Specific ADP Integration - Critical P0 Implementation

## 🚨 Priority Level: P0 (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Fantasy dashboard using irrelevant industry ADP instead of SFB15-specific tournament data
**Solution**: Integrate real SFB15 ADP from GoingFor2 mock drafts + dynamic source management

---

## Problem Statement

Our current dashboard calculates "value" by comparing projections to industry ADP (Sleeper/FantasyPros), which is optimized for standard fantasy leagues. SFB15 has unique scoring rules that dramatically change player values compared to standard leagues. This means:

- Our value calculations are fundamentally wrong for tournament play
- Players undervalued in standard leagues may be properly valued in SFB15
- Draft strategy based on wrong ADP leads to poor tournament results
- We're building a hobby tool instead of a competitive advantage

## Solution Overview

[GoingFor2.com](https://goingfor2.com/sfb15adp/) runs the ONLY actual SFB15 mock drafts with 299+ players, providing true tournament ADP data. This PR integrates that data as the primary ADP source with dynamic blending capabilities.

---

## 🚀 Implementation Details

### 1. New SFB15 ADP Scraper (`src/data/sfb15_adp_scraper.py`)

**Key Features**:
- Robust web scraping of GoingFor2 SFB15 ADP table
- Handles 299+ players with real tournament draft positions
- Data validation and quality checks
- Automatic retry logic and fallback to cached data
- Respects server rate limits with appropriate delays

**Data Structure Parsed**:
```
| Rank | Position | First Name | Last Name | ADP | Number of Mocks |
|------|----------|------------|-----------|-----|-----------------|
| 1    | RB       | Bijan      | Robinson  | 1.98| 47              |
| 2    | WR       | Ja'Marr    | Chase     | 2.96| 47              |
```

**Validation Checks**:
- Minimum 250+ players (expected 290+)
- ADP values between 0.5-350
- Required columns present
- Position distribution validation
- Mock count quality scoring

### 2. Enhanced ADP Manager (`src/data/adp_manager.py`)

**New Capabilities**:
- Multi-source ADP blending with configurable weights
- Default: SFB15 (70%), Sleeper (20%), FantasyPros (10%)
- Real-time source switching for different league contexts
- Source health monitoring and status indicators
- ADP source comparison for value arbitrage

**Key Methods Added**:
```python
# Weighted blending of multiple ADP sources
get_blended_adp(sources, weights) -> pd.DataFrame

# Dynamic source prioritization
switch_primary_source(source: str) -> None

# Cross-source value identification
compare_adp_sources() -> pd.DataFrame

# Real-time source health monitoring
get_source_health_status() -> Dict[str, Dict]
```

### 3. Dashboard ADP Controls (`src/dashboard/components/sidebar.py`)

**New UI Components**:
- **Primary ADP Source Selection**: Choose SFB15, Sleeper, or FantasyPros
- **Source Health Indicators**: Real-time status with player counts and update times
- **Advanced Blending Controls**: Custom weight sliders for multi-source blending
- **Normalized Weight Display**: Shows final calculated weights

**User Experience**:
```
🎯 ADP Source Configuration
Primary ADP Source: [SFB15 ▼]

📡 Source Status:
🟢 SFB15: 299 players (2.1h old)
🟢 SLEEPER: 8505 players
🟡 FANTASYPROS: 4 players

☑ Advanced ADP Blending
  SFB15 Weight: ████████████████████████████ 70%
  Sleeper Weight: ████████ 20%
  FantasyPros Weight: ████ 10%
```

### 4. Main App Integration (`app.py`)

**Enhanced Data Flow**:
1. Initialize enhanced ADPManager with SFB15 scraper
2. Pass ADP manager to sidebar for real-time controls
3. Handle dynamic source switching based on user selection
4. Update ADP blends when weights change
5. Provide fallback to cached data if scraping fails

**Error Handling**:
- Graceful fallback to cached SFB15 data if scraping fails
- Multi-source redundancy if primary source unavailable
- User feedback on data freshness and source health

- **True Sleeper Identification**: Players undervalued specifically in SFB15 context
- **Market Efficiency Analysis**: Identify tournament-specific inefficiencies
- **Competitive Advantage**: Only tool using actual SFB15 draft data

### For Flexibility
- **Dynamic Source Switching**: Adapt to different league types on-the-fly
- **Blended ADP Intelligence**: Combine multiple sources for maximum insight
- **Real-time Health Monitoring**: Know when data is fresh vs stale
- **Source Comparison**: Identify value arbitrage opportunities

### For Reliability
- **Robust Error Handling**: Multiple fallback mechanisms
- **Data Validation**: Ensure scraped data quality
- **Caching Strategy**: Work offline with recent data
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful server interaction

## 📊 Data Impact

### Before (Industry ADP)
- **Sleeper**: 8,505 players (standard league optimized)
- **FantasyPros**: Limited data (standard league consensus)
- **Accuracy**: Wrong for SFB15 unique scoring

### After (SFB15 ADP Primary)
- **SFB15**: 299 players (tournament-specific data)
- **Blended**: Weighted combination of all sources
- **Accuracy**: Calibrated for actual SFB15 draft behavior

### Value Calculation Changes
```python
# Before: Wrong context
value = projection_rank - industry_adp_rank

# After: Tournament context
value = projection_rank - sfb15_weighted_adp_rank
```
