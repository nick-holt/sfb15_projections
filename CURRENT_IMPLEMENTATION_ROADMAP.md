# CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
## ðŸŽ¯ Dashboard Reorganization: Research Hub + Live Draft

**Current Status**: Basic dashboard working, needs restructure for two core functions

## ðŸš¨ P0 CRITICAL: SFB15-Specific ADP Integration (IMMEDIATE)

**Priority Level**: P0 (HIGHEST - Must implement before any other work)
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours
**Dependencies**: None - this is foundational for draft accuracy

### Why This is P0 Critical:
- Industry ADP (Sleeper/FantasyPros) is optimized for standard leagues
- SFB15 has unique scoring that dramatically changes player values
- GoingFor2 runs actual SFB15 mock drafts providing true tournament ADP
- Without SFB15 ADP, our value calculations are meaningless for tournament play
- This is the difference between a hobby tool and a competitive advantage

### Implementation Tasks:

#### Task P0.1: SFB15 ADP Scraper (1.5 hours)
**Objective**: Build robust scraper for GoingFor2 SFB15 ADP data

**Data Source Analysis**:
- URL: https://goingfor2.com/sfb15adp/
- Table structure: Rank | Position | First Name | Last Name | ADP | Number of Mocks
- Current data: 299 players with live ADP values
- Updates: Real-time based on actual SFB15 mock drafts

**Implementation**:
```python
# src/data/sfb15_adp_scraper.py
class SFB15ADPScraper:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_url = "https://goingfor2.com/sfb15adp/"
        self.headers = {
            'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 SFB15-Dashboard/1.0'
        }
    
    def scrape_live_adp(self) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Scrape current SFB15 ADP table"""
        # Parse the table with 299+ players
        # Handle dynamic loading if needed
        # Return standardized DataFrame
        
    def parse_adp_table(self, soup) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Parse the ADP table from BeautifulSoup object"""
        # Extract table rows with player data
        # Handle name concatenation (First + Last)
        # Validate ADP numeric values
        
    def validate_adp_data(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> bool:
        """Validate scraped data quality"""
        # Check for expected player count
        # Validate ADP ranges
        # Ensure no missing critical data
```

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Functional SFB15 ADP scraper
- [ ] Error handling for scraping failures
- [ ] Data validation and quality checks
- [ ] Fallback to cached data if scraping fails

#### Task P0.2: Multi-Source ADP Management (1 hour)
**Objective**: Enhance ADPManager to handle multiple ADP sources with dynamic weighting

**Implementation**:
```python
# Enhanced src/data/adp_manager.py
class EnhancedADPManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sources = {
            'sfb15': SFB15ADPScraper(),
            'sleeper': SleeperADPFetcher(),
            'fantasypros': FantasyProsADPFetcher()
        }
        self.source_weights = {
            'sfb15': 0.70,      # Primary source for SFB15
            'sleeper': 0.20,    # Secondary for market context
            'fantasypros': 0.10  # Tertiary for consensus view
        }
    
    def get_blended_adp(self, sources: List[str] = None, 
                       weights: Dict[str, float] = None) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Calculate weighted ADP from multiple sources"""
        
    def switch_primary_source(self, source: str) -> None:
        """Dynamically switch primary ADP source"""
        
    def compare_adp_sources(self) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Compare ADP across all sources for analysis"""
```

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Multi-source ADP blending
- [ ] Dynamic source weighting
- [ ] Source comparison analytics
- [ ] Real-time source switching in UI

#### Task P0.3: Dashboard ADP Source Controls (0.5 hours)
**Objective**: Add UI controls for ADP source management

**Implementation**:
```python
# Enhanced sidebar controls
def render_adp_source_controls():
    st.subheader("ðŸŽ¯ ADP Source Configuration")
    
    # Primary source selection
    primary_source = st.selectbox(
        "Primary ADP Source",
        options=['sfb15', 'sleeper', 'fantasypros'],
        index=0,  # Default to SFB15
        help="Choose your primary ADP source"
    )
    
    # Source weighting sliders
    if st.checkbox("Advanced Blending"):
        sfb15_weight = st.slider("SFB15 Weight", 0.0, 1.0, 0.70)
        sleeper_weight = st.slider("Sleeper Weight", 0.0, 1.0, 0.20)
        fp_weight = st.slider("FantasyPros Weight", 0.0, 1.0, 0.10)
        
    # Live source status indicators
    render_source_status_indicators()
```

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] ADP source selection controls
- [ ] Blending weight sliders
- [ ] Source health indicators
- [ ] Real-time ADP switching

#### Task P0.4: SFB15-Specific Value Calculations (1 hour)
**Objective**: Recalibrate value calculations using SFB15 ADP

**Key Changes**:
- Replace industry ADP with SFB15 ADP in all value calculations
- Adjust value tier thresholds for SFB15 context
- Add SFB15-specific market efficiency metrics
- Create SFB15 draft strategy recommendations

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] SFB15-calibrated value metrics
- [ ] Updated sleeper/bust identification
- [ ] SFB15 market efficiency scoring
- [ ] Tournament-specific draft strategy

### Success Metrics:

- [ ] Real-time ADP updates every 2-4 hours
- [ ] Accurate value calculations using SFB15 data
- [ ] Source switching working in live dashboard
- [ ] Improved value identification vs industry ADP

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Scraping Failures**: Implement robust retry logic and fallback to cached data
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect GoingFor2 server with appropriate delays
- **Data Quality**: Validate scraped data against expected ranges
- **Source Availability**: Always maintain 2+ backup ADP sources
