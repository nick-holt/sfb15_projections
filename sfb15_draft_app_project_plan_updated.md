# SFB15 Fantasy Football Draft Dashboard - Updated Implementation Plan

**Status**: ✅ Phases 1-9 Complete | 📋 Phase 10+ Planning | 🚨 P0 CRITICAL ADDED

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL P0: SFB15-Specific ADP Integration (IMMEDIATE)

**Why This is Priority Zero**:
The current dashboard uses industry ADP (Sleeper/FantasyPros) which is optimized for standard fantasy leagues. SFB15 has unique scoring rules that dramatically change player values compared to standard leagues. Without SFB15-specific ADP data from actual tournament mocks, our value calculations are fundamentally flawed for tournament play.

**The Problem**:
- Our "value" calculations compare projections to irrelevant industry ADP
- Players undervalued in standard leagues may be properly valued in SFB15
- Draft strategy based on wrong ADP leads to poor tournament results
- We're building a hobby tool instead of a competitive advantage

**The Solution**:
[GoingFor2.com runs actual SFB15 mock drafts](https://goingfor2.com/sfb15adp/) with 299+ players, providing the ONLY true SFB15 ADP data available. This is the difference between guessing and knowing actual tournament values.

### Implementation Requirements:

#### P0.1: SFB15 ADP Scraper (1.5 hours)
- Build robust scraper for GoingFor2 SFB15 ADP table
- Handle 299+ player table with real tournament ADP values  
- Implement retry logic and error handling for scraping failures
- Validate data quality against expected player counts and ADP ranges

#### P0.2: Multi-Source ADP Management (1 hour)
- Enhance ADPManager to blend multiple ADP sources with configurable weights
- Default: SFB15 (70%), Sleeper (20%), FantasyPros (10%)
- Enable real-time source switching for different league contexts
- Add source comparison analytics for value arbitrage opportunities

#### P0.3: Dashboard ADP Controls (0.5 hours)
- Add UI controls for ADP source selection and weighting
- Display source health indicators and last update times
- Enable advanced blending with custom weight sliders
- Show ADP source comparison for transparency

#### P0.4: SFB15-Calibrated Value Metrics (1 hour)
- Recalibrate all value calculations using SFB15 ADP as primary source
- Adjust sleeper/bust identification thresholds for tournament context
- Create SFB15-specific market efficiency metrics
- Generate tournament-optimized draft strategy recommendations

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Successfully scraping 290+ players from GoingFor2 every 2-4 hours
- [ ] Value calculations using true SFB15 ADP instead of industry ADP
- [ ] Real-time ADP source switching working in dashboard
- [ ] Improved value identification accuracy for tournament play

**Timeline**: Must complete before any Phase 10+ work begins
