# SFB15 Fantasy Football Projections

This repository contains the code and data for building a season-long fantasy football projection model for the Scott Fish Bowl 15 (#SFB15).

The goal is to produce accurate and reproducible player projections for the 2025 NFL season to assist in fantasy drafts.

See the [Project Tracker](fantasy_projection_project_tracker.md) for a detailed plan and task board.
