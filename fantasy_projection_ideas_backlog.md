## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUES - IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED

**Current Status:** âœ… **RESOLVED** - The quick projections have been fixed and now produce realistic results.

### Issue Analysis & Resolution (December 2024)
- **Problem:** Patrick Mahomes projected at 1,770 points (~104 pts/game over 17 games)
- **Root Cause:** Historical data was treating season totals as per-game averages
- **Solution Applied:** Proper conversion of `total_points` to per-game averages with games-played normalization
- **Current Results:** Realistic projections (Mahomes: 321 pts, Allen: 391 pts, Barkley: 413 pts)

## ðŸ”¥ NEW HIGH PRIORITY - PIPELINE IMPROVEMENTS

**Current Status:** Manual fallback system working, but ML models need integration.

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Next 1-2 weeks)

| Priority | Item | Effort | Impact | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| **`P0 - CRITICAL`** | **Fix ML Model Persistence** | 4 hours | High | Models train successfully but don't save/load properly. Need to debug model serialization in `04_train_models.py` and `06_generate_2025_predictions.py` |
| **`P0 - CRITICAL`** | **Hybrid ML + Manual System** | 6 hours | High | Use ML models as base predictions, apply manual adjustments for validation and edge cases |

## Phase 1 â€” Data Ingestion & Cleaning

| Idea | Rationale / Notes |
|------|-------------------|
| **`COMPLETED` - Scoring System Audit** | âœ… Verified fantasy scoring is correct. Issue was data interpretation, not scoring rules. |
| **`COMPLETED` - Games Played Normalization** | âœ… Fixed per-game normalization in projection logic. All historical averages now properly calculated. |
| **Add combine & athletic testing data** | Heightâ€‘adjusted speed score, burst scoreâ€”can proxy upside for rookies. Sources: NFLCombineResults.com, `nflreadr::combine`.
| **Coach & scheme table** | Headâ€‘coach + OC IDs, historical passâ€‘rateâ€‘overâ€‘expected (PROE); can help model usage shifts after coordinator changes.
| **Weather & dome flags** | Simple oneâ€‘hot for homeâ€‘stadium dome (IND, NO, DAL, ATL, DET, LV, ARI, MIN, LAR). Minor but free signal.
| **Depth chart start-ofâ€‘season snapshot** | Merge FantasyLife's Week 1 projected starters to capture camp battles.
| **Data versioning via DVC** | Lightweight tracking of `data/raw` to ensure downstream reproducibility without bloating Git.
| **Unit tests for scoring function** | Verify 1:1 with official SFB14 scoring on a handful of handâ€‘calculated plays; guards against future rule tweaks.

## Phase 2 â€” Feature Engineering

| Idea | Rationale / Notes |
|------|-------------------|
| **`COMPLETED` - Per-Game Feature Recalculation** | âœ… All projection logic now uses proper per-game calculations with games-played normalization. |
| **`HIGH PRIORITY` - QB Starter Probability Feature** | The QB model's high RMSE is likely due to difficulty separating starters from backups. Engineer features to predict `is_starter` status. Sources: Depth charts (FantasyLife), Vegas odds, team contract data, prior season snap counts. This will be the most impactful next step for QB accuracy.
| **`COMPLETED` - Realistic Baseline Validation** | âœ… Validated against 2024 results. Current projections align well with actual performance. |
| **Exponentialâ€‘decay weighted stats** | Gives 2024 > 2023 > 2022 weightâ€”tune Î» inside Optuna.
| **Injury propensity index** | Logistic model using games_missed_last3, BMI, position; output probability to miss â‰¥2 games.
| **Player similarity embeddings** | UMAP/Tâ€‘SNE of raw perâ€‘play vectors â†’ kâ€‘nearest historical comps; add the average futureâ€‘points of comps as feature.
| **Age*Usage interaction term** | Captures diminishing returns for older highâ€‘touch RBs.
| **Team pace & play volume** | Merge FootballOutsiders secondsâ€‘perâ€‘play; multiply by Vegas implied totals for a "plays opportunity" metric.
| **Contractâ€‘year flag + years_remaining** | RBs historically see uptick in touches in contract years.
| **Stackâ€‘rank percentile features** | Convert certain aggregates into withinâ€‘position percentiles (e.g., targets %).
| **Lagged efficiency deltas** | Yearâ€‘overâ€‘year change in yards per carry/route, capturing improving/declining skill.

## Phase 3 â€” Modeling & Evaluation

| Idea | Rationale / Notes |
|------|-------------------|
| **`COMPLETED` - Projection Sanity Checks** | âœ… Added position-specific caps and validation against historical maximums. |
| **`COMPLETED` - Cross-Validation Against 2024 Actuals** | âœ… Validated projections against known 2024 results. Scale and accuracy confirmed. |
| **`IN PROGRESS` - Positionâ€‘specific subâ€‘models** | âœ… Models exist and trained successfully, but need proper persistence/loading integration. |
| **Quantile regression** | CatBoost supports `Quantile:alpha=0.9` â†’ gives upside distribution for riskâ€‘adjusted drafting.
| **TabNet or FTâ€‘Transformer** | Deepâ€‘learning tabular models may capture higherâ€‘order interactions; useful experiment for 1â€‘week bakeâ€‘off.
| **Monotonic constraints in LightGBM** | Force projections to increase with positive features (e.g., more targets â‡’ more points) to reduce nonsense.
| **Blending with public consensus** | Linear blend (Î») with FantasyPros ECR or ESPN projections; often boosts accuracy outâ€‘ofâ€‘sample.
| **SHAP clustering heatmap** | Visual sanity check that drivers make football sense (age negative, targets positive, etc.).
| **Kâ€‘fold OOB ensembling** | 5Ã— CatBoost models with different seeds; average predictions for variance reduction.
| **Costâ€‘sensitive evaluation** | Weight errors by ADP; small misâ€‘rank within top 24 matters more than a miss on the RB56.

## Phase 4 â€” Final Training & Export

| Idea | Rationale / Notes |
|------|-------------------|
| **Postâ€‘hoc injury adjustment** | Multiply projection by (1 â€“ injury probability) for floorâ€‘seeking drafter variant.
| **Tier smoothing** | Apply isotonic regression to enforce nonâ€‘decreasing rank order after ensemble blending.
| **Scenario generator** | Produce "Best 5 %", "Median", "Worst 5 %" quantile projections for risk diagnostics.
| **Timeâ€‘stamp model file with Git SHA** | Easier traceability when multiple rebuilds occur.

---

## Phase 5 â€” Deployment & Handoff

| Idea | Rationale / Notes |
|------|-------------------|
| **REST endpoint for projections** | FastAPI wrapper so the draft app can pull live data rather than reading static Parquet.
| **Lightweight Streamlit prototype** | Quick smoke test UI before full Shiny build; supports dragâ€‘andâ€‘drop CSV of draft board.
| **Onâ€‘draft pick tracking** | Socket connection listening to Sleeper API; autoâ€‘recalculates top available players.
| **CI badge in README** | Visual cue that pipeline passes on latest commit.
| **Schedule nightly cron in Julyâ€“August** | Autoâ€‘refresh ADP, injuries, and reâ€‘score; send email diff if rank delta > 5 for any topâ€‘36 player.
| **Automated PDF summary** | Quarto renders top 200 projections with SHAP insights so you have a printable cheat sheet.

## Niceâ€‘toâ€‘Have / Stretch Ideas
- **Reinforcementâ€‘learning draft bot** that simulates endâ€‘toâ€‘end drafting vs. market to learn optimal pick strategy.
- **Inâ€‘season weekly projection pipeline** reusing most features but switching target to Week X fantasy points.
- **Live GCP Vertex ML pipeline** for scaleâ€‘out hyperâ€‘parameter sweeps if local hardware becomes bottleneck.
