"""
Forward-Looking Feature Engineering (No Data Leakage)

This script creates proper forward-looking features where:
- To predict season X performance, only use data from seasons X-1, X-2, etc.
- No current season data can be used to predict current season outcomes

Key principle: When training models for year Y, we can only use information
that would have been available BEFORE year Y started.
