## üîç PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION

### Original Issues Discovered
- **QB Ceiling Crisis**: Max QB prediction (263.6) was 284 points below FootballGuys elite (547.3)
- **WR Talent Blindness**: Model ranked random depth players over proven WR1s
- **Flat Distributions**: Too much parity, not enough elite-to-replacement separation
- **Missing Opportunity Features**: No target shares, usage rates, or situational metrics

### Root Cause Analysis
‚úÖ **Completed comprehensive feature engineering audit**  
- Identified 23 critical missing features across all positions
- Found models using only basic career stats, missing usage patterns
- Discovered lack of team context and situational modeling
